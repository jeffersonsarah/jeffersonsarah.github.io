<h4> I am a very hard working person with everything that I do. I play my sport, golf, which makes me a very competitive person. Golf has taught me a lot about myself and how I deal with difficult and mentally challenging situations. </h4>

<p> One of my favorite hobbies is playing golf. I am fortunate enough to be able to play golf for my college so I get to play and practice everyday. I have been playing since I was nine, so I've been playing for over ten years now. It is one of my favorite things to do. When I'm not playing golf or doing school work then I'm listening to music. I love to listen to Taylor Swift, Adele, Olivia Rodrigo, and many others. Listening to music gives me a break from the outsie world and allows me to be in my own world. I was fortunate enough to see Taylor Swift in Nashville back in May. It was my faorite thing and I was able to create the best memories with my friends because of it. </p>
